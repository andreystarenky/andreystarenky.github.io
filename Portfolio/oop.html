<u>Inheritance</u><br/>
</font>
<font size="4"><mbr/>
Inheritence is the concept that involves objects taking on properties of already existing objects or classes.<br/>
This uses the parent-child class relationship, also known as <i>Superclass - Subclass</i>.<br/>
In Java, inheriting a class is used with the keyword <i>extends</i> (ex. Public class Cat <i>extends</i> Animal)<br/>
A Subclass can access any of the super's public variables and methods. To protect variables from being accidentally modified, the Superclass's vairables are set to <i>private</i>,<br/>
and getter/setter methods are used to obtain and change the value of the variables.<br/>
A Subclass can also Override any of the super's methods if needed.<br/><br/>

<u>Encapsulation</u><br/>
</font>
<font size="4"><mbr/>
Encapsulation is the structured design of a class. It incorporates a set attributes along with a set of methods to be able to retrieve and change these variables<br/>
As mentioned previously, these methods are called "getters" and "setters" than can return or change the values<br/>
Encapsulation is a basic concept that is key for all Object Oriented Programming<br/><br/>

<u>Abstraction</u><br/>
</font>
<font size="4"><mbr/>
Abstraction is a key concept of Object-Oriented Programming that is incorporated into the blueprint factor of Superclasses. Abstraction is used to tell the subclasses which methods they<br/>
need to incorporate individually. This ensures that the child classes are following the template provided by the Abstract class and can have all necessary behaviours.<br/>
Methods apply abstraction by using the key word <i>abstract</i> (ex. public abstract void move();).<br/>
Abstract methods may not have any code in them at the Parent level. Any class that incorporates abstract methods needs to include the key word <i>abstract</i> before <i>class</i> (ex. public abstract class Animal())<br/>
Interfaces are classes that only have abstract methods, and are signified by the key word <i>Interface</i> before <i>class</i> (ex. public interface LifeCycle())<br/><br/>

<u>Polymorphism</u><br/>
</font>
<font size="4"><mbr/>
Polymorphism is simply the ability of a certain object to take on many forms, and is also a key concept in Object Oriented Programming.<br/>
The concept of Polymorphism is typically seen when a variable of Superclass type is used to refer to a Subclass object. This is classified as an "is-a" relationship.<br/>
The two main types of casting that occur in Polymorphism are <i>Downcasting</i> and <i>Upcasting</i><br/><br/>
